              <h4>CCSH Emergency Notice - August 2043</h4>
              <span>
                  The Corporate City State of Helsinki apologizes for the interruption in citizen's schedules due to the ongoing emergency.
                  <br>
                  Despite the lack of basic necessities in many areas of the city, we remind citizens to remain calm, as plans for increasing the gruel supply are already underway. Do not panic.
<br><br>
Human Intelligence Tasks are currently unavailable, but will be released later as schedule permits.
                  <br>
                  Further information on the barrier enveloping the city and other such minor inconveniences will be made available later by our trusted partners at Dvergar, along with some job offers of course. <a href="brokenLink">See here for more information</a>.
